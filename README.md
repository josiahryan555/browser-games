# Browser Arcade Game Fun!

This is a folder in which I will play around with browser arcade games.

My goal is to learn and have fun!

To play any of the games, simply open the file, and click on the .html file (hopfully named something helpful like "main.html").  You will have to click into the browser to make your keyboard input work in the game.
