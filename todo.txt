Ideas for the Moving_Balloon_Popper:
- make balloons do damage to player
  - currently broken.  It might be XMovingPlayerShip.js line 61 (that is where the thrown error is) but
  it might be the 'this.destroyed()' line in a function, but taking it out didnt fix the problem




- add more levels, constantly getting harder?
- make it 3D
- add scoreing
- add lives
