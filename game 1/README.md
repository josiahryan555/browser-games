# Game 1

I plan for this to be a galaga style game

Working:
- moveable player who can shoot
- enemies that can be shot (and will disappear after being shot)

To do:
1. Make a score counter and just make the game a "hit the ballons" style game where more ballons appear after every level

2. make enemies move, shoot, and do damage to player
